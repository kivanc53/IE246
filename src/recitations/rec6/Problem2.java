/*
    Write a code piece that prints the common elements between two arrays of integers.
    The arrays will be separated with "separator", and will be inputted with the args array.

//		The elements until the "separator" will form the first integer array, where the remaining
//		elements form the second integer array.
//		e.g. 1 2 9 4 6 3 separator 2 9 5 1 2
//		in this case, array 1: 1 2 9 4 6 3, array 2: 2 9 5 1 2
//
//		Output:
//		1 is common in both arrays
//		2 is common in both arrays
//		9 is common in both arrays
//
//		Notice that even though 2 was repeated twice, it is printed once
