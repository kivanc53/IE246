/*
    Provide a class named die, that uses a Random object and has two methods: one that returns the outcome for a die roll,
    and one that returns how many given values are observed among a given number of rolls.
    I should be able to do the following:
    Random random = new Random();
    Die die = new Die(random);
    int outcome = die.roll(); // outcome becomes 1,2,3,4,5, or 6.
    int count = die.experiment(5,10000) // count becomes how many 5's are observed among 10000 die rolls.
