/*
   Write a code piece that prints the common elements between two arrays of integers.
   The arrays will be in length of 5 each, and will be inputted with the args array.
   The first 5 elements of the array will form the first integer array, where the last 5 elements form the second integer array.
    e.g. 1 2 9 4 6 3 2 9 5 1
    in this case, array 1: 1 2 9 4 6, array 2: 3 2 9 5 1
    Output:
    1 is common in both arrays
    2 is common in both arrays
    9 is common in both arrays
