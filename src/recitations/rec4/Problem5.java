/*
    Write a method to check whether an year (integer) is a leap year or not.
    To be a leap year, the year number must be divisible by four â€“ except for end-of-century years,
     which must be divisible by 400.
     This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.
     2020, 2024 and 2028 are all leap years.
