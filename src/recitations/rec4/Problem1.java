/*
    Write a code piece that prints the common elements between two arrays of integers.
    The arrays will be separated with "separator", and will be inputted with the args array.
    The elements until the "separator" will form the first integer array,
    where the remaining elements form the second integer array.
    e.g. 1 2 9 4 6 3 separator 2 9 5 1
    in this case, array 1: 1 2 9 4 6 3, array 2: 2 9 5 1
    Output:
    1 is common in both arrays
    2 is common in both arrays
    9 is common in both arrays
