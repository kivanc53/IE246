/*
    Create a Rectangle class that has the length and width attributes.
    From the main method, we should be able to Draw the circumference of the given rectangle object,
    where top and bottom borders are - as many as length,
    and sides for each row are | (as many as width minus 2) with space in between (as many as length minus 2).
    Examples for smaller values are below. Compute the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
    So we should be able to do the following:

    // even if we wrote new Rectangle(10,5), it should create the same object and provide the "exact same" outputs!
    Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(5,10);
    rectangle.draw();
        ----------
        |        |
        |        |
        |        |
        ----------
    int area = rectangle.calculateArea();
    int perimeter = rectangle.calculatePerimeter();
